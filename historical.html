<hr></center>


<p>The Kingdom of Kelantan started in about 1757 when Long Yunus from Patani was appointed as the Raja of Kelantan for his good relationship with Sultan Mansur of Terengganu. When Long Yunus passed away, a Terengganu prince was made the king but was opposed by Long Yunus's descendants. Long Yunus's descendants won and remained as the present royal family of Kelantan.

Interesting facts about British and Japanese occupation in Kelantan can be seen in the War Museum. The first place that the Japanese soldiers landed in Malaysia was in Kelantan. Because the Siamese gave the Japanese soldiers passage to enter Malaya, Kelantan was taken over by the Japanese in a very short period.</p>
